in a forest
at a baseball game
on top of a mountain
at the summit of a mountain
at the summit of a volcano
in the slums
in a haunted forest
in a <adj> forest
on a busy street
on a <adj> street
in a back alley
in the suburbs
in a huge city
in the red-light district
outside an apartment complex
in a jungle
near a river
in a wheat field
in the middle of nowhere
at a lemonade stand
in a desert
in a crowded marketplace
in a deserted marketplace
in a <adj> marketplace
at a riverbank
in the hood
at the Mexico-USA border
at the <geo>-<geo> border
on the moon
deep under the earth
