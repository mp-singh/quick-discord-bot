in the year <tinynum> thousand
in the year 1998
in the seventies
forty years ago
<num> years ago
many years ago
during the Vietnam War
in the 21st century
in the midst of an epic struggle
in the midst of a <event>
at a time of great misfortune
during summer
in the winter
in the not-too-distant future
in an alternate dimension
not too long ago
just yesterday
when the flowers were blooming
when it was too late
during World War II
during the reign of Stalin
after the fall of the Iron Curtain
in the middle-ages
in the dark-ages
in Victorian times
